# Jalsetu : A IoT enabled device for your tank

This was a semester-wide project for the course "Internet of Things" (COCSE20) from students of Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT).

## About This project

Water is such an essential commodity for our day to day lives and yet India is placed at 120th amongst 122 countries in the Water Quality Index, with nearly 70% of water being contaminated. The part problem is the governments failure to address the issue seriously and people not understanding how contaminated their water actually is. Ofcourse drinking contaminated water may not always be harmful immediately but small steps goes a long way (and here, it is not in a good way).

### `Our Solution`

We present a way to see the qualitative and quantitative analysis of water tank in forms of simple numbers. Our project "Jalsetu" comprises of 2 words : "Jal" (water) and "Setu" (bridge). Our product acts like a bridge which brings user closer to the truth about the water they are consuming.
The product is a device which can be directly installed to users water tank. Once installed, user can check their water level, pH, quality and monthly bill too from the personal dashboard provided.
For future scope, we can mine the data of user's water quality and mapping it with users area, we can send reports to government or local authorities helping them in pinpointing places where water quality needs urgent care.

### `Components Used`

For this project, we used the following hardware/software technologies : <br/>
• ESP32 <br/>
• Turbidity Sensor <br/>
• pH & Temperature Sensor <br/>
• Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 <br/>
• ReactJs <br/>
• Material UI <br/>
